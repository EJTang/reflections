When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when working on separate devices.
When you want to make your files accessable to others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because if it automatically pulled something, it could introduce bugs and/or ruin what you are currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
a fork is a clone inside github so the original creator will still be able to get credit from it
a clone is a direct copy of someones repository from git, this does not have any reference to the originaly repository if we were to push it as our own repository later on
branches are branched off sections of our repository that allow us to modify code without affecting the main code in case we break anything

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
because this can let us compare from that state and the state we are currently working in.
