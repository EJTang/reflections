When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when working on separate devices.
When you want to make your files accessable to others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because if it automatically pulled something, it could introduce bugs and/or ruin what you are currently working on.
